# musicgenre
Machine learning model that predicts the genre of music (either classical music or jazz) given features of a song. Uses this dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vicsuperman/prediction-of-music-genre

This project is in progress. I will first create an SVM model determining if a song belongs to the classical or jazz genre. Next, I plan to explore other algorithms like K-means, random forest, etc. Eventually, I will consider ensembling or a boosting algorithm to combine the different algorithms. 

The code is written in Jupyter Notebook. In-class projects from Introduction to Machine Learning at Yonsei International Summer School (taught by Woong Lim) were used as a reference for writing this code.
